      <h2 id="intro_h">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The RStudio IDE has many features and options to help you work the way that best suits your needs.</p>
      <p>
        Some features discussed in this article require RStudio 1.3 or newer. In a few cases you need to know if
        you are using RStudio Desktop or RStudio Server. If RStudio is loaded in your web browser, then you are
        using RStudio Server, otherwise you have RStudio Desktop.

      <h2 id="zoom_h">Zoom Level</h2>
      <p>
        The size of text and other RStudio user-interface elements can be adjusted using the Zoom feature.</p>
      <p>
        For RStudio Desktop, use the "Zoom In", "Zoom Out", or "Actual Size" commands on the View menu.</p>
      <p>
        RStudio Server relies on your web browser's zooming features. Consult web browser help for more details.</p>

      <h2 id="themes_h">Look and Feel</h2>
      <p>
        You can change the look and feel of the RStudio user interface by choosing from three RStudio themes, and
        many editor themes. Use the Tools / Global Options / Appearance settings pane to experiment and find the
        look that works best for you.</p>
      <p>
        Pebble-Safe is a colorblind-friendly theme created by Desi Quintans. It can be downloaded and installed from
        the <a href="https://github.com/DesiQuintans/Pebble-safe">Pebble-Safe GitHub page</a>.</p>
      <p>

        <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes">Using RStudio Themes
          article</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="keyboard_h">Keyboard</h2>
      <p>
        Many RStudio features can be operated entirely with the keyboard. Using the keyboard can be an
        efficient way to get things done whether you are a keyboard-only user, or just prefer to reduce how often
        you have to reach for the mouse or touchpad.</p>
      <h3>
        Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        RStudio has many keyboard shortcuts to trigger actions, move between areas of the user interface, and so on.
        Many of these can be discovered by browsing the main menu, hovering the mouse cursor over toolbar
        buttons, and viewing keyboard shortcut reference from the Help / Keyboard Shortcut Help menu.</p>
      <p>
        Keyboard shortcuts may be customized using the Tools / Modify Keyboard Shortcuts menu. For more on this,
        see the <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts">
        Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts article.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving between RStudio's various tabs such as the Console and the Source Editor can be achieved using shortcuts
        such as Ctrl+1 to move to the editor tab, and Ctrl+2 to move to the Console. Many more such commands are found
        under the View menu.</p>
      <p>
        The keyboard shortcuts available for manipulating text in the Source Editor will vary depending which editor
        keybindings are selected in Global Options / Code / Keybindings.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Main Menu</h3>
      <p>
        In RStudio Desktop, the main menu is operated via keyboard the same as the main menu in other applications on
        your operating system. For example, on Microsoft Windows, Alt+F will open the file menu.</p>
      <p>
        RStudio Server, however, has slightly different shortcuts for activating its main menu items. As a starting
        point, on Windows and Linux, use Alt+Shift+F to activate the File menu, or Alt+Shift+H for the Help menu. Once
        a menu is opened, use the left and right arrows keys to move between menus, and up and down arrows to navigate
        within the current menu, just like on RStudio Desktop. A full list of Main Menu shortcuts is available in the
        Help / Keyboard Shortcuts reference. If you wish to customize these shortcuts, they are named "Show File Menu",
        "Show Help Menu", and so on.</p>
      <h3>
        Navigating Dialog Boxes</h3>
      <p>
        When a dialog box such as Global Options is opened, you can move around it using a combination of arrow keys
        and Tab and Shift+Tab. Generally the spacebar and/or Enter key can be used to "click" a button, just like
        other desktop applications.
      </p>
      <h2 id="motion_h">Reduced Motion</h2>
      <p>
        Some aspects of RStudio's user interface use subtle motion or animations. There is an option to eliminate
        these via the Tools / Global Options / Accessibility / Reduce User Interface Animations checkbox.

      <h2 id="simplify_h">Simplify Layout</h2>
      <p>
        RStudio's main window is quite visually complex. There is a menubar at the top, a toolbar, and up to four 
        quadrants each potentially containing many different types of tabs which in turn contain RStudio's many 
        features! Additionally, some features will open entirely new windows.</p>
      <p>
        We recognize that this is overwhelming when first learning to use RStudio, and potentially distracting even if
        you are experienced with the product. Unfortunately there are limitations to simplifying the UI in current
        versions of the product. That said, there are some things you can try.</p>
      <h3>
        Zooming a Region</h3>
      <p>
        One strategy you can employ is to "zoom" the region you are currently using. For example,
        View / Panes / Zoom Console will cause the Console to fill the entire RStudio Window. Note this is a different
        meaning of "Zoom" than was mentioned earlier in this document where it referred to changing the overall size
        of all elements in the window.</p>
      <p>
        The keyboard shortcut for zooming a pane is often the same as for moving to the pane, plus the Shift key. So,
        Ctrl+Shift+2 will zoom the Console; use the same sequence to un-zoom the Console and restore the prior
        layout.</p>
      <p>
        For mouse users, there are also widgets in the upper-right corner of each quadrant which can be used to
        maximize and minimize that particular quadrant.</p>
      <p>
        Another strategy to employ is zooming a single column of the user interface. For example, in the default
        layout the Source Editor is in the top-left (assuming you have some files open) and the Console is below it.
        If you then use View / Panes / Zoom Left Column, those two panes will expand to fill the entire main window.</p>
      <h3>
        Customizing Pane Layout</h3>
      <p>
        Another tool you can experiment with is customizing which quadrants contain certain tabs, as well
        as where each quadrant is displayed relative to the others. This is configured via View / Panes / Pane Layout
        dialog (also available within the Global Options dialog under Pane Layout).</p>
      <p>
        The Source and Console quadrants are currently fixed in terms of what tab-types may appear in them. You can,
        however, configure the other two quadrants to hold specific tabs. The only limitation is that a quadrant must
        contain at least one tab, so it is not possible to completely eliminate one quadrant. Still, you can move the
        tabs you don't routinely use into one quadrant then minimize that quadrant, give what is essentially a 3
        panel layout.</p>
